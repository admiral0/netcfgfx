This is a fork of netcfgGUI found here http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/netcfgGUI?content=99509

Its goal is to run without requiring root rights and adapt to new netcfg and wpa_actiond

What you should expect:
Gui working
Netcfg works when run as user (sudo setup needed) 
Pretty notifications

sudoers line
%network ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/netcfg, /usr/sbin/iwlist, /etc/rc.d/net-auto-wireless, /etc/rc.d/net-auto-wired
